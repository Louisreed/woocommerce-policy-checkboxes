# woocommerce-policy-checkboxes
This plugin adds a compulsory checkbox to the checkout page in WooCommerce that must be checked in order for the customer to place their order. The checkbox reads "You must accept the privacy policy" and has a link to the privacy policy page. A second checkbox for the refunds and returns policy is also included.
